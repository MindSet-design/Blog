Firebase is being used for user credentials/data storage and syncfusion for visualizing the data. I made this project not cause I thought anthing would come from it but it was project I made that has an actual use and problem to solve. As of now I have no one using it but as of now it is open and available, if you want to know more check it out @ https://moreinformed-auth-dev.web.app/"

It allows me to track and invoice organizations that I do work for instead of just using something like an e-transfer. Now that I have this up and running I am looking for more career work that I could work full-time while maintaining IOTops.ca on the side to see if anything comes of it."
